  expertise: "Urban Geography, Feminist Geography, Feminist Theory, Critical Race Theory, Urban Social Theory, Social Action Research, Urban Labor Markets, Urban Poverty, Societal Dimensions of Information and Communication Technologies, Social Movements"
  bio: "My research interests are in areas of urban geography, feminist and critical race studies, and social action research. I have approached these broad and interconnected fields through theoretically informed, empirical research examining how urban and economic processes construct, and are constructed by relations of power and inequality. I am particularly interested in the barriers that poor women of various ethnic/”racial” groups experience, and the individual and collective survival strategies that they employ, in attempting to support themselves and their families. And, because I am interested in social change, and the role of academics and research in this process, she has utilized social action research as part of a broader feminist methodology. My primary research contributions have been to offer alternative theoretical and methodological approaches to study the intersection of gender, racism, and space to further our understanding of labor markets, urban poverty, community organizing and digital inequalities. My current research examines the relationships among access to information and communication technology (ICT), poor women’s economic opportunities, and poor people’s community-based organizing from a feminist geographical perspective. This research focuses on the relationships among access to information and communication technologies (ICTs); economic, educational, and health disparities; and poor people’s community-based organizing in the United States. My research has been supported by the Fulbright Commission, the National Science Foundation, and the Social Science Research Council. My research has been published in journals such as the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, the Professional Geographer, Urban Geography, Geoforum, Transactions in GIS, and Information, Communication & Society. I received my PhD (1994) and MA (1991) from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University and a MA (1988) in Urban and Regional Studies from the University of Sussex. I currently serve as Chair of the Department of Geography and Urban Studies and Director of the Greater Philadelphia Women’s Studies Consortium. I am serving a term as Treasurer and National Councillor of the Association of American Geographers and serve on the editorial boards of Urban Geography and Geographical Review. I have served as president of the Geographical Perspectives on Women Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers and received the 2011 Jan Monk Service Award for contributions to the advancement of women and feminist geography in the discipline and the broader public. I have also worked with a number of community organizations related to economic empowerment and digital inequalities. I am currently Vice President of the Board of Directors of the Lower Merion School District in suburban Philadelphia and a former member of the Montgomery County Planning Commission Board in Pennsylvania."

This project is a meditation on what it means to do justice to traumatic legacies through an engagement with such objects."

  expertise: "Gender and Work Social Stratification Poverty & Social Policy Family Social Demography"
  bio: "I am interested in poverty and social policy, gender and work, and the relationship between the two. In recent work, I am concerned with how women’s social interactions guide their economic outcomes. This question is central to my 2013 book, Ain't No Trust: How Bosses, Boyfriends, and Bureaucrats Fail Low-Income Mothers and Why It Matters (University of California Press). The book provides a qualitative comparison of low-income mothers’ experiences with welfare and low-wage work before and after welfare reform and investigates women’s social interactions with caseworkers, employers, child care providers, romantic partners, and networks of family and friends.  I argue that these social interactions produce distrust creating barriers to the very actions reform hoped to promote.  Policies that do not address the structural factors that shape these interactions and produce distrust -- particularly the fact that low-income mothers' interests are often at odds with their interaction partners -- will be limited in their ability to truly improve the lives of low-income women and their children. The book is available for purchase here and here. To learn more about this research, watch my appearance onMSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry show; or read my essay in Boston Review; or read coverage of the book in Pacific Standard; or see the NBC News interview on the book; or listen to a podcast about the book put out by the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; or to an interview with WHYY's Radio Times hosted by Marty Moss-Coane. In other work, I have studied how informal social interactions between co-workers reinforce formal institutional barriers to sex integration in job titles in a manufacturing plant. I have also investigated the causal links between adolescent motherhood and children’s subsequent outcomes and the relationship between mothers’ and fathers’ occupational traits and children’s occupational aspirations."
