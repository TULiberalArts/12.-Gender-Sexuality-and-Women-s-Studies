Continue your education with a graduate-level [women’s studies certificate](#graduate-certificate-program) at the College of Liberal Arts. Need more information before getting started? View the [requirements](#requirements) and [admissions info](#admissions) below.

## Graduate Certificate Program
A Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies can be earned at Temple in conjunction with master's or doctoral work in a wide variety of subjects. The certificate can also be earned through a freestanding course of study not linked to a graduate degree. Graduate students whose work is focused on gender will be able to explore central concepts of feminist theory and analysis through Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies graduate courses.

Please visit the [Gender, Sexuality & Women's Studies Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/gender-sexuality-and-womens-studies) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## Requirements
Each student must complete 6 semester hours of course work in the Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Program:

- GSWS 8001: Introduction to Feminist Studies (3 credits)
- GSWS 9991: Seminar in Feminist Reseach (3 credits)

In addition, students take at least 6 semester hours in approved courses that focus on gender from their own or any cooperating department and complete a research project. Students working on a Temple graduate degree may satisfy the research requirement by focusing on women or gender in their final project, thesis or dissertation.

## Admissions
If the certificate is to be obtained in conjunction with a master's or doctoral degree, students already admitted to a cooperating Temple University graduate program will be accepted to the Women's Studies Certificate Program on the basis of an internal application and graduate transcripts.
