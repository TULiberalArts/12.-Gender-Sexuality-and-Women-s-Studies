## Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies Graduate Program
Factors of gender and sexuality have a multifaceted effect on both individuals and society as a whole. Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies graduate program students learn advanced knowledge about feminist concerns throughout history and into contemporary times. By studying literature and culture, graduate students build theoretical knowledge about feminist advocacy, develop analytical skills and gain a stronger understanding of gender identities. These lessons help graduates affect positive societal changes for all genders while increasing their ability to succeed in careers like education, media, politics, counseling and more.

## Graduate Certificate Program
Students in the Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies graduate certificate program acquire and develop methodological and theoretical expertise in the interdisciplinary field of Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies. The certificate can be pursued by graduate students already enrolled in a Temple University graduate degree program, or as a freestanding certificate by persons who are not enrolled in a Temple University graduate degree program. 

Temple graduate students complete the certificate requirement while simultaneously fulfilling the graduate requirements for their degree-granting department. All students complete the same course requirements to earn the certificate. And all certificate students join and benefit from a community of graduate students and faculty committed to the study of gender and sexuality in a wide range of disciplines.
