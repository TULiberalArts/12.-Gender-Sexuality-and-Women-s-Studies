## Graduate Certificate Program
A Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies can be earned at Temple in conjunction with master's or doctoral work in a wide variety of subjects. The certificate can also be earned through a freestanding course of study not linked to a graduate degree. Graduate students whose work is focused on gender will be able to explore central concepts of feminist theory and analysis through Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies graduate courses.

## Admissions
If the certificate is to be obtained in conjunction with a master's or doctoral degree, students already admitted to a cooperating Temple University graduate program will be accepted to the Women's Studies Certificate Program on the basis of an internal application and graduate transcripts.
