## Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies Graduate Program
Factors of gender and sexuality have a multifaceted effect on both individuals and society as a whole. Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies graduate program students learn advanced knowledge about feminist concerns throughout history and into contemporary times. By studying literature and culture, graduate students build theoretical knowledge about feminist advocacy, develop analytical skills and gain a stronger understanding of gender identities. These lessons help graduates affect positive societal changes for all genders while increasing their ability to succeed in careers like education, media, politics, counseling and more.

## Graduate Certificate Program
A Graduate Certificate in Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies can be earned at Temple in conjunction with master's or doctoral work in a wide variety of subjects. The certificate can also be earned through a freestanding course of study not linked to a graduate degree. Graduate students whose work is focused on gender will be able to explore central concepts of feminist theory and analysis through Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies graduate courses.

## Admissions
If the certificate is to be obtained in conjunction with a master's or doctoral degree, students already admitted to a cooperating Temple University graduate program will be accepted to the Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies Certificate Program on the basis of an internal application and graduate transcripts.

Students not enrolled in a Temple University graduate degree program who are applying for the freestanding certificate must submit the following:

- A completed external application form, which may be also obtained as a hard copy from the Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies Program in 811 Anderson Hall.
- An official transcript of all previous college work, showing a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university and an undergradute - GPA of at least 3.0 (on a four-point scale)
