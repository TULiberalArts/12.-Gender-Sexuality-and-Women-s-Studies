## Graduate Certificate Program

A Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies can be earned at Temple in conjunction with master's or doctoral work in a wide variety of subjects. The certificate can also be earned through a freestanding course of study not linked to a graduate degree.

Graduate students whose work is focused on gender will be able to explore central concepts of feminist theory and analysis through Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies graduate courses.

## Requirements

Each student must complete 6 semester hours of course work in the Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies Program:

- GSWS 8001: Introduction to Feminist Studies (3 credits)
- GSWS 9991: Seminar in Feminist Reseach (3 credits)

In addition, students take at least 6 semester hours in approved courses that focus on gender from their own or any cooperating department and complete a research project. Students working on a Temple graduate degree may satisfy the research requirement by focusing on women or gender in their final project, thesis, or dissertation.

For descriptions of all Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies courses please go to the [Graduate Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/courses/gsws/).

## Admissions

If the certificate is to be obtained in conjunction with a master's or doctoral degree, students already admitted to a cooperating Temple University graduate program will be accepted to the Women's Studies Certificate Program on the basis of an internal application and graduate transcripts.
