## Our Program
The Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies program welcomes students interested in an intersectional approach to gender, sexuality, race and other key identities and the consequences these intersections have in people’s lives. Our courses range from foundations in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies to gender violence to LGBTQ activism, literature and theory. As an interdisciplinary program housed in the College of Liberal Arts, we explore the many variables that contribute to women's experience as a social group, gender as an analytical category, and the social, political and cultural functioning of sexuality.

Above all else, we listen to what you want to learn about. Our students work independently as well as in groups, join student organizations and land internships throughout the region in various industries. Many of our courses are cross-listed with other courses, which makes it easier for students to graduate on time.
