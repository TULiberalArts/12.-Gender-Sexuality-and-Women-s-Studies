The Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies program welcomes students interested in an intersectional approach to gender, sexuality, race and other key identities and the consequences these intersections have in people’s lives. Our courses range from foundations in Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies to gender violence to LGBTQ activism and theory.

Many of our courses are student-driven. Above all else, we listen to what our students want to learn about. Our students work independently, as well as in groups, join student organizations and land internships throughout the region in various industries. Many of our courses are cross-listed with other courses, which makes it easier for students to graduate on time.
