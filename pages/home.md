  The Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies program welcomes students interested
  in an intersectional approach to gender, sexuality, race and other key
  identities and the consequences these intersections have in people’s lives.
  Our courses range from foundations in Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies to
  gender violence to LGBTQ activism and theory.

Above all else, we listen to what you want to learn about. Our students work independently as well as in groups, join student organizations and land internships throughout the region in various industries. Many of our courses are cross-listed with other courses, which makes it easier for students to graduate on time
