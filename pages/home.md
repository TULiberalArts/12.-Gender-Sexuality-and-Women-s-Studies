  The Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies program welcomes students
  interested in an intersectional approach to gender, sexuality, race and other
  key identities and the consequences these intersections have in people’s
  lives. Our courses range from foundations in Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s
  Studies to gender violence to LGBTQ activism and theory. As an
  interdisciplinary program housed in the College of Liberal Arts, we explore
  the many variables that contribute to women's experience as a social group,
  gender as an analytical category, and the social, political and cultural
  functioning of sexuality.

Above all else, we listen to what you want to learn about. Our students work independently as well as in groups, join student organizations and land internships throughout the region in various industries. Many of our courses are cross-listed with other courses, which makes it easier for students to graduate on time.
