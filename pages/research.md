## Greater Philadelphia Women's Studies Consortium

In addition to the lectures, forums and workshops sponsored by the Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies Program, the program plays a key role in the Greater Philadelphia Women's Studies Consortium (GPWSC). Through the Consortium, we bring major scholars, performers, activists and writers to Temple and to the region through an annual Scholar in Residence initiative. The Consortium also sponsors an annual student activism workshop and supports the annual Geis Women's Studies Student Conference at the University of Delaware. Temple's Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies Program had the privilege to host conferences in 2015 and 2016 as part of the Consortium.
