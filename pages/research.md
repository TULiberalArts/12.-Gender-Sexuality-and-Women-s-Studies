## Where to start?
Ask the Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies Librarian, [Caitlin Shanley](https://library.temple.edu/about/staff/caitlin-shanley). She has expertise in feminist and queer research methods and can help you with your GSWS papers and assignments by helping you find, evaluate, and use relevant sources and information.  

Need help writing a paper, a resume, a cover letter for a job, a graduate school personal statement, a scholarship essay, or creative writing? [The Writing Center](https://www.temple.edu/class/programs/writing/index.html) offers a variety of tailor-made programs to help you through all of the stages of your writing process: from brainstorming to final revisions. And they can do it all in English or Spanish.   

## Present Your Research 
Presenting your research is a great way to build confidence in public speaking, a skill that’s integral to many careers. Formal presentations make your graduate school applications more impressive, too.

Written a research paper or created a work of art for a class? Share it with the Temple community at the annual [Temple Undergraduate Research and Creative Works Forum (TURF-CReWS)](http://www.temple.edu/vpus/opportunities/researchscholars.htm). TURF-CReWS gives ambitious undergraduate students the opportunity to present their scholarly and creative works at a day-long symposium that brings together students and their friends and family, as well as faculty from across the university. 

The [Diamond Research Scholars Program](http://www.temple.edu/vpus/opportunities/researchscholars.htm) gives undergraduate students the opportunity to pursue an intensive research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor during the summer and fall. Diamond Research Scholars develop their research skills in an all-day Undergraduate Research Institute.

## Greater Philadelphia Women's Studies Consortium
Take your research beyond Temple. Temple’s GSWS Program is a member of the Philadelphia Women’s Studies Consortium. In addition to the lectures, forums and workshops sponsored by the Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Program, the program plays a key role in the Greater Philadelphia Women's Studies Consortium (GPWSC). Through the Consortium, we bring major scholars, performers, activists and writers to Temple and to the region through an annual Scholar in Residence initiative. The Consortium also sponsors the annual Student Research on Women, Gender, and Sexualities Conference featuring the work of graduate and undergraduate students at the Consortium’s 14 member colleges and universities.
