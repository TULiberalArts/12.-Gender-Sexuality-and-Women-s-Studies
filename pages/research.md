## Greater Philadelphia Women's Studies Consortium

In addition to the lectures, forums and workshops sponsored by the Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Program, the program plays a key role in the Greater Philadelphia Women's Studies Consortium (GPWSC). Through the Consortium, we bring major scholars, performers, activists and writers to Temple and to the region through an annual Scholar in Residence initiative. The Consortium also sponsors the annual Student Research on Women, Gender, and Sexualities Conference featuring the work of graduate and undergraduate students at the Consortiumâ€™s 14 member colleges and universities.
