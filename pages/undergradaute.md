The College of Liberal Arts’ Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies is a small, close-knit program where students receive individual attention from faculty. If you want to further your education on these important issues without earning a full degree our [Certificate of Specialization in GSWS](#gender-sexuality-and-womens-studies-certificate-of-specialization) or minor in [Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies]() could be the perfect option for you.

## Unmatched Support
Our students benefit from small classes taught by renowned faculty who conduct cutting edge research on gender and sexuality. In addition to our core faculty, there are more than 60 faculty both within CLA and in other schools across the university, who are affiliated with our program. Many of these faculty teach courses that our majors and minors can take to fulfill requirements. All of them are committed to the goal of gender and sexuality-based equity.

Our undergraduate program prepares students to meet these demands. Our students learn actively through fieldwork and internships connected to their career interests. Our graduates pursue graduate degrees in every field and go on to have careers in business, teaching, healthcare, technology, social work, government, the arts, and much more.
