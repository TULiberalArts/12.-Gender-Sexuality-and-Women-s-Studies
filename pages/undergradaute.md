## Unmatched Support

Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies is a small, close-knit program where students receive individual attention from faculty. Our goal is to help our students become leaders while following their unique passions and interests. The program also hosts many on-campus events in collaborations with other programs at Temple.

## An Honest Approach

The Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies program provides students with sensitivity of mind and a freedom of thought to think about issues pertaining to gender, race, sexuality, class, age, disability, nationality and other pertinent issues. We encourage and challenge our students to make connections and come to a deeper understanding of the world around them.
