The College of Liberal Arts’ Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies degree offers unmatched support and an honest approach to your education. And if you want to further your education on these important issues without earning a full degree, either our gender, sexuality and women’s studies [certificate](#gender-sexuality-and-womens-studies-certificate-of-specialization) or [Jewish women’s studies certificate](#jewish-womens-studies-certificate) could be the perfect option for you.

## Unmatched Support
Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies is a small, close-knit program where students receive individual attention from faculty. Our goal is to help our students become leaders while following their unique passions and interests. The program also hosts many on-campus events in collaborations with other programs at Temple.

## An Honest Approach
The Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies program provides students with sensitivity of mind and a freedom of thought to think about issues pertaining to gender, race, sexuality, class, age, disability, nationality and other pertinent issues. We encourage and challenge our students to make connections and come to a deeper understanding of the world around them.

## Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies Certificate of Specialization
The Certificate of Specialization is designed for students outside the College of Liberal Arts who want to pursue a Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies-oriented career. Four courses are required for the certificate: Intro to Women's Studies (1096), Field Work (4389), and 2 electives, at least one of which must be at the upper level.

## Jewish Women's Studies Certificate
