## Unmatched Support

Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies is a small, closeknit program where students receive individual attention from our faculty. We support a student organization and student newsletter aimed at making our students voices heard. Our goal is to help our students become leaders while following their hearts. The program also hosts many on-campus events in collaborations with other programs here at Temple.

## Renowned Faculty

Our program is run by core faculty members who are excellent advisors, as well as affiliated faculty from diverse programs from across Temple University. Students learn from faculty they respect and who are well known in their respective fields.

## An Honest Approach

The Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies program provides students with sensitivity of mind and a freedom of thought to think about issues pertaining to gender, race, sexuality, class, age, disability, nationality and other pertinent issues. We encourage and challenge our students to make connections and come to a deeper understanding of the world around them.
