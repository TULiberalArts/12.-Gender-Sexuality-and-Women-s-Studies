The College of Liberal Arts’ Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies is a small, close-knit program where students receive individual attention from faculty. If you want to further your education on these important issues without earning a full degree, either our gender, sexuality and women’s studies [certificate](#gender-sexuality-and-womens-studies-certificate-of-specialization) or [Jewish women’s studies certificate](#jewish-womens-studies-certificate) could be the perfect option for you.

## Unmatched Support
Our goal is to help our students become leaders while following their unique passions and interests. The program also hosts many on-campus events in collaborations with other programs at Temple. The Gender, Sexuality, and Women’s Studies program provides students with sensitivity of mind and a freedom of thought to think about issues pertaining to gender, race, sexuality, class, age, disability, nationality and other pertinent issues. We encourage and challenge our students to make connections and come to a deeper understanding of the world around them.

## Bachelor of Arts in Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies
Undergraduate Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies degree program students are taught to see women’s position in society through new lenses. They’re taught to understand gender influences and to challenge gender constructs in modern society. And a focus on discrimination and inequality empowers them to forward the goal of achieving a more equitable society for all genders. Coursework covers historic, economic, social, cultural and political issues as they relate to women. Students will experience a transformation of these traditional fields of study by exploring them through a feminist framework.
